## Have you ever thought about studying math graphs without sight?
 
The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. That is why most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because of an inaccessible content. In this respect, sonification and auditory graphs have been a primary tool for providing non-visual access to data using sound. However, the representation of detailed elements in graphs remains unexplored. Here is a new attempt to make the graphs more interpretable for the blind.




## Three mathematical elements of graphs weâ€™ve focused
1. x-axis (parallel & serial mode)
2. Quadrants (with & without quadrants information)
3. Differentiability (with & without speech information)




## Can you guess the graph?
